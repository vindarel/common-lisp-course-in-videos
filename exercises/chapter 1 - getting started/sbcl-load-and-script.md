In our first video, when we installed and ran SBCL, we used a code
snippet to NOT have the interactive debugger pop-up on an error.  In
the second video, about using `--script` and `--load` to run a .lisp file,
I was still not using it.

Your task: try the `--load` and `--script` options with the debugger.
