> To start with, thanks to the author to create a course like this so that new Lispers (to Common Lisp at least) can learn something new. I've been working with (or managing to at least) Emacs Lisp for about a decade but wanted to get a little closer to Lisp, which brings me here. I took this course as a supplement to the book amazing book Land of Lisp in order to get more "practical" insights into Common Lisp, and how it's been used by "real" lispers. Vincent does a great job talking about the concepts and often also alerts the audience of a few gotchas here and there. He also does a decent job at explaining a few concepts that may be alien to most people who aren't really familiar with Lisp concepts. Having said that, I felt that there were still plenty of concepts that could be covered a little closer and some of which I could only understand due to my familiarity with Lisp due to my reading from Land of Lisp. Finally, I'll keep an eye on future additions to the course!

> Thanks for the course on CL. I enjoyed most of time, particularly the videos with a new mic. However, some videos are hard to understand due to the microphone and English pronunciation. I was mostly able to follow, but sometimes concepts and language features were used without prior introduction or an appropriate explanation at the time of using it. Definitely recommend to use further introductory books on CL. Some topics are missing e.g. in-depth classes and macros. I still do not understand what a symbol is actually ^-^

Tom, September of 2022, rated 3/5 (valuable information, accurate course description, engaging delivery, knowledgeable instructor, but lacking helpful practice activities and not so clear explanations). He is right that some topics are currently missing. I am still working on new content.

> I get distracted because of his french accent.

Dietmar, October of 2022. Doing my best and started to practice with a friend :S (one note: there are subtitles to help).

> Very thorough! And the lisp cookbook online was a great supplement/introduction to the concepts in this course :)

> [french] J'en suis à la moitié. La pédagogie est au rendez-vous et c'est vraiment cool! Ça donne envie d'aller plus loin. Merci pour ce travail.

("I did half of the course. Pedagogy is there as expected and it's really cool! Thus one wants to see more. Thanks for this work.")
